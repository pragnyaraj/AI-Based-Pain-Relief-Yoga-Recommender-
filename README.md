# AI-Based-Pain-Relief-Yoga-Recommender-

# Introduction to the project
The project focuses on developing an AI-Based Pain Relief Yoga Recommender System.
It combines artificial intelligence with traditional yoga practices to offer personalized pain relief solutions.
The system leverages computer vision (OpenCV, MediaPipe) and machine learning to analyze user postures.
It provides real-time feedback and corrective suggestions to ensure safe and effective practice.
Designed to assist individuals with chronic pain or physical discomfort using non-invasive, holistic methods.
Promotes health, wellness, and accessibility through intelligent automation and user-centered design.
 
# Prpblem formulation
Many individuals suffer from chronic pain due to sedentary lifestyles, poor posture, or medical conditions.
Traditional yoga, while effective, lacks personalized guidance and requires expert supervision.
Most existing yoga apps offer static content without real-time feedback or posture correction.
Incorrect yoga poses can aggravate pain or lead to injuries, especially without supervision.
There is a need for an intelligent system that can guide users in real time and adapt to their pain profiles.
The goal is to create an AI-based system that offers customized yoga recommendations for safe and effective pain relief.

# Objectives of the Work
✅ To develop an AI-powered yoga recommender system for effective pain relief.
✅ To use pose estimation and computer vision techniques for accurate posture detection.
✅ To classify yoga poses using a deep learning model trained on user posture data.
✅ To provide real-time feedback and posture correction during yoga sessions.
✅ To personalize yoga routines based on user pain areas and performance history.
✅ To ensure a safe, interactive, and accessible wellness experience using AI technologies.
✅ To track user progress and offer performance analytics for motivation and improvement.
